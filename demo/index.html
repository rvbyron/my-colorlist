<div>
  <p style="background-color: #fcc">Fixed! This was fixed using a MutationObserver attached to each my-color element and
    calling the updateStyles function on the nodes. Refer to the file my-color.html and compare with the previous version(s).

<h2>List iterators and styling</h2>
  <p>I'm having trouble styling a list of components. The key thing that is the issue is that I am using iron-list and
    passing in a custom CSS property to a sub element. Because everything is computed ahead of time by Polymer, I am losing
    the dynamic nature of the styling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The list initially starts with 2 red items.</li>
  <li>'Click to Switch Color' empties the list and adds 4 'blue' items.</li>
  <li>Clicking again goes back to red and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in both lists, even though the element attributes and labels appear correct, the styling is not being reflected properly.
  Clearly, something is wrong. Can anyone fix the CSS style to show correctly?</p>
<h3>Example my-colorlist</h3>
<p>The template in this component uses an iron-list</p>
<my-colorlist></my-colorlist>
<br>
-------<br>
<h3>Example my-colorrepeat</h3>
<p>The template in this component uses a dom-repeat</p>
<my-colorrepeat></my-colorrepeat>
</div>
</body>
